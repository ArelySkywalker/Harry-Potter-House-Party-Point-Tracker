# Harry Potter House Party Point Tracker

This is going to be a re-vamped version of my Harry Potter House party. This will be built using Vue.js!

### Install and Usage

To install, navigate to the /vue/ directory and run `npm install`

To run the development server use: `npm run dev`

To build the production version use: `npm run build`

All code should be within the src folder.

App.vue is our main application wrapper and calls all our other components.

main.js is the main script file that instantiates Vue and other libraries.


### Notes

FontAwesome Pro has been included however it is not free. In order to use FontAwesome Pro you need to install the fonts into the webfonts folder.
