# Harry Potter House Party Point Tracker

This is going to be a re-vamped version of my [Harry Potter House Party](https://github.com/ArelySkywalker/HarryPotterHouseParty). This will be built using Vue.js!

### About

This app will be used to create users and assign them to a House. There's two type of users, students & prefects. Prefects are allowed access to the points form to add/remove points from their house. Students are able to login and view how many points they have and how much points other houses have. Students are not allowed to add/remove points. 

Points are awarded by various actions such as, bringing food/drinks to the party, taking a shot, making drinks for people, acting out a scene in Harry Potter, or something custom deemed point approval by their prefect.

### Install and Usage
